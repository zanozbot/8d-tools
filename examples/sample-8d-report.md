## D4: Verify Root Causes and Escape Points

### Root Cause Analysis

#### Potential Root Causes
1. **Material defect in supplier component**
   - Investigation: Supplier changed material composition without notification
   - Evidence: Chemical analysis shows different polymer blend
   - Verification: Confirmed through supplier audit

2. **Process parameter deviation during production**
   - Investigation: Temperature settings were within spec but at lower end
   - Evidence: Production logs show 2°C lower than optimal
   - Verification: Correlation with failure pattern confirmed

3. **Quality control test inadequacy**
   - Investigation: Current tests don't simulate long-term stress
   - Evidence: Failed units pass all standard QC tests
   - Verification: Extended stress testing reveals failure mode

#### Root Cause Verification
**Primary Root Cause:** Supplier changed material composition from polymer blend A to blend B without notification, reducing component durability under stress.

**Contributing Factors:**
- Production temperature at lower end of specification range
- Quality control tests insufficient for detecting long-term durability issues

### Escape Points
1. **Incoming inspection** - Failed to detect material composition change
2. **Production quality control** - Tests didn't simulate real-world stress conditions
3. **Final inspection** - No long-term durability verification

#### Why Wasn't It Caught?
- Supplier change control process bypassed
- Incoming material testing focused on dimensions, not composition
- QC tests designed for immediate functionality, not durability
- No stress testing in production environment

## D5: Choose Permanent Corrective Actions

### Proposed Solutions

1. **Enhanced Supplier Control**
   - Description: Implement mandatory change notification and approval process
   - Pros: Prevents unauthorized changes, maintains quality consistency
   - Cons: May slow supplier responsiveness
   - Risk Assessment: Low risk, high benefit

2. **Improved Incoming Inspection**
   - Description: Add material composition testing to incoming inspection
   - Pros: Catches material changes before production
   - Cons: Increases inspection time and cost
   - Risk Assessment: Medium cost, high benefit

3. **Enhanced Quality Control Testing**
   - Description: Add accelerated stress testing to QC process
   - Pros: Detects durability issues before shipment
   - Cons: Increases testing time and equipment needs
   - Risk Assessment: Medium cost, very high benefit

### Selected Solution
**Combination approach implementing all three solutions:**
1. Enhanced supplier change control with mandatory notifications
2. Material composition testing in incoming inspection
3. Accelerated stress testing in quality control

### Verification Plan
- Pilot implementation with next production batch
- Monitor for 30 days with enhanced testing
- Customer feedback tracking for 90 days
- Supplier audit within 60 days
