## D0: Plan and prepare

### Problem background

A significant increase in product defects was observed in our main production line during the week of December 8-15, 2024. Customer complaints increased by 300% compared to the previous month, with reports of premature component failure affecting approximately 150 units shipped to customers.

### Prerequisites

- Access to production data from December 1-15, 2024
- Quality control inspection reports
- Customer complaint database
- Production team availability for interviews
- Laboratory testing capabilities for failed components

### Initial assessment

The problem appears to be isolated to products manufactured between December 8-12, 2024. Initial inspection suggests a potential issue with the adhesive bonding process in Station 3 of the production line. Estimated impact: $45,000 in potential warranty claims and customer goodwill.

## D2: Identify the problem

### Problem statement

Between December 8-12, 2024, the defect rate for Product Model X increased from the normal 0.5% to 8.2%, resulting in 123 defective units out of 1,500 produced. The primary failure mode is adhesive bond failure occurring within 48 hours of customer use.

### 5W2H analysis

- **Who:** Customers using Product Model X manufactured December 8-12, 2024
- **What:** Adhesive bond failure causing component separation
- **When:** Failures occurring 24-48 hours after customer installation
- **Where:** Station 3 adhesive bonding process in main production line
- **Why:** Unknown - requires investigation
- **How:** Adhesive appears to lose bonding strength prematurely
- **How many:** 123 units affected out of 1,500 produced (8.2% defect rate)

### Problem quantification

- Normal defect rate: 0.5% (7-8 units per 1,500)
- Problem period defect rate: 8.2% (123 units per 1,500)
- Increase factor: 16.4x normal rate
- Customer complaints: 89 received (vs. normal 2-3 per month)
- Estimated cost impact: $45,000 in warranty and goodwill

### Supporting evidence

- Production logs showing temperature and humidity variations
- Quality control inspection data
- Customer complaint photos showing bond failure patterns
- Laboratory analysis of failed components

## D3: Develop interim containment plan

### Immediate actions

1. **Immediate halt:** Stop shipment of all Product Model X units produced December 8-12
2. **Customer notification:** Contact all customers who received affected units
3. **Inspection protocol:** Implement 100% adhesive bond strength testing for all new production
4. **Quarantine:** Isolate remaining inventory from affected production dates

### Containment verification

- 100% inspection implemented with pull-test verification (minimum 50 lbs force)
- Customer service tracking all incoming complaints
- Daily production quality reports to team leader
- No defective units shipped since December 16

### Customer protection

- Proactive replacement program for all affected units
- 24/7 customer service hotline established
- Expedited shipping for replacement units
- Extended warranty coverage for affected customers

### Implementation date

Containment measures implemented December 16, 2024, at 6:00 AM.

## D4: Verify root causes and escape points

### Root cause analysis

#### Potential root causes

1. **Adhesive material issue:** Batch contamination or degradation
2. **Process parameter deviation:** Temperature, pressure, or timing variations
3. **Environmental factors:** Humidity or temperature changes in production area

#### Root cause verification

**Primary root cause identified:** Adhesive storage temperature exceeded specification limits.

**Evidence:**

- Temperature logs show adhesive storage area reached 85°F on December 7-8 (specification: max 75°F)
- HVAC system malfunction confirmed by maintenance records
- Laboratory testing confirmed adhesive viscosity changes at elevated temperatures
- Correlation analysis shows 100% match between high-temperature exposure and defective batches

### Escape points

The problem escaped detection at two critical points:

#### Why wasn't it caught?

1. **Incoming inspection:** Adhesive temperature monitoring was visual-only, not recorded
2. **Process control:** No real-time adhesive temperature monitoring during application
3. **Final inspection:** Bond strength testing was sampling-based (10%) rather than 100%

## D5: Choose permanent corrective actions

### Proposed solutions

1. **Solution 1: Enhanced Temperature Control**

   - Description: Install automated temperature monitoring and control system for adhesive storage
   - Pros: Prevents temperature excursions, provides real-time alerts, data logging
   - Cons: Higher initial cost ($15,000), requires maintenance
   - Risk assessment: Low risk, proven technology

2. **Solution 2: Alternative Adhesive**
   - Description: Switch to temperature-resistant adhesive formulation
   - Pros: More forgiving of temperature variations, potentially better performance
   - Cons: Requires qualification testing, higher material cost, supply chain changes
   - Risk assessment: Medium risk, requires extensive validation

### Selected solution

**Solution 1: Enhanced Temperature Control** was selected based on:

- Lower implementation risk
- Faster implementation timeline (2 weeks vs. 8 weeks)
- Addresses root cause directly
- Cost-effective long-term solution

### Verification plan

- Install temperature monitoring system with ±1°F accuracy
- Set alarm limits at 73°F (warning) and 75°F (critical)
- Implement automatic HVAC adjustment
